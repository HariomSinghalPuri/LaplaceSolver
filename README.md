# ðŸ§  Laplace-based ODE Solver in Java

This is a console-based Java application that solves **second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** using the **Laplace Transform** method. It allows the user to enter a differential equation and initial conditions, applies Laplace Transform, solves algebraically, and returns the time-domain solution via Inverse Laplace Transform â€” all with a step-by-step breakdown.
